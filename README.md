We're going to build a "Hello, World!" program using Solana Playground. Solana Playground is a tool that allows you to write and deploy Solana programs from the browser.

1. Setup
   Open https://beta.solpg.io/ . Next, go ahead and delete everything in the default lib.rs file and create a Playground wallet. Rename to sayHello.rs and delete native.test.ts
